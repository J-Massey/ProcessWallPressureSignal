	abstract = {Integrals of the mean and turbulent energy dissipation rates are examined using direct numerical simulation (DNS) databases in a turbulent channel ﬂow. Four values of the Kármán number (h+ = 180, 395, 640 and 1020; h is the channel half-width) are used. Particular attention is given to the functional h+ dependence by comparing existing DNS and experimental data up to h+ = 104. The logarithmic h+ dependence of the integrated turbulent energy dissipation rate is established for 300 6 h+ 6 104, and is intimately linked to the logarithmic skin friction law, viz. Ub+ = 2.54 ln(h+) + 2.41 (Ub is the bulk mean velocity). This latter relationship is established on the basis of energy balances for both the mean and turbulent kinetic energy. When h+ is smaller than 300, viscosity affects the integrals of both the mean and turbulent energy dissipation rates signiﬁcantly due to the lack of distinct separation between inner and outer regions. The logarithmic h+ dependence of Ub+ is clariﬁed through the scaling behaviour of the turbulent energy dissipation rate ε in different parts of the ﬂow. The overlap between inner and outer regions is readily established in the region 30/h+ 6 y/h 6 0.2 for h+ {\textgreater} 300. At large h+ ({\textgreater}5000) when the ﬁnite Reynolds number effect disappears, the magnitude of εy/U3 τ approaches 2.54 near the lower bound of the overlap region. This value is identical between the channel, pipe and boundary layer as a result of similarity in the constant stress region. As h+ becomes large, the overlap region tends to contribute exclusively to the 2.54 ln(h+) dependence of the integrated turbulent energy dissipation rate. The present logarithmic h+ dependence of Ub+ is essentially linked to the overlap region, even at small h+.},

	abstract = {Direct numerical simulations are used to examine large-scale motions with a streamwise length 2 ∼ 4h (h denotes the channel half-width) in the logarithmic and outer regions of a turbulent channel ﬂow. We test a minimal ‘streamwise’ ﬂow unit (Toh \& Itano, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 524, 2005, pp. 249–262) (or MSU) for larger Kármán numbers (h+ = 395 and 1020) than in the original work. This ﬂow unit consists of a sufﬁciently long (Lx + ≈ 400) streamwise domain to maintain near-wall turbulence (Jiménez \& Moin, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 225, 1991, pp. 213–240) and a spanwise domain which is large enough to represent the spanwise behaviour of inner and outer structures correctly; as h+ increases, the streamwise extent of the MSU domain decreases with respect to h. Particular attention is given to whether the spanwise organization of the large-scale structures may be represented properly in this simpliﬁed system at sufﬁciently large h+ and how these structures are associated with the mean streamwise velocity U. It is shown that, in the MSU, the large-scale structures become approximately two-dimensional at h+ = 1020. In this case, the streamwise velocity ﬂuctuation u is energized, whereas the spanwise velocity ﬂuctuation w is weakened signiﬁcantly. Indeed, there is a reduced energy redistribution arising from the impaired global nature of the pressure, which is linked to the reduced linear–nonlinear interaction in the Poisson equation (i.e. the rapid pressure). The logarithmic dependence of ww is also more evident due to the reduced large-scale spanwise meandering. On the other hand, the spanwise organization of the large-scale u structures is essentially identical for the MSU and large streamwise domain (LSD). One discernible difference, relative to the LSD, is that the large-scale structures in the MSU are more energized in the outer region due to a reduced turbulent diffusion. In this region, there is a tight coupling between neighbouring structures, which yields antisymmetric pairs (with respect to centreline) of large-scale structures with a spanwise spacing of approximately 3h; this is intrinsically identical with the outer energetic mode in the optimal transient growth of perturbations (del Álamo \& Jiménez, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 561, 2006, pp. 329–358).},

	abstract = {The celebrated wall-scaling works for many statistical averages in turbulent ﬂows near smooth walls, but the streamwise velocity ﬂuctuation, u′, is thought to be among the few exceptions. In particular, the near-wall mean-square peak, u′u′+ p – where the superscript + indicates normalization by the friction velocity uτ , the subscript p indicates the peak value and the overbar indicates time averaging – is known to increase with increasing Reynolds number. The existing explanations suggest a logarithmic growth with respect to Re, where Re is the Reynolds number based on uτ and the thickness of the wall ﬂow. We show that this boundless growth calls into question the veracity of wall-scaling and so cannot be sustained, and we establish an alternative formula for the peak magnitude that approaches a ﬁnite limit u′u′+ ∞ owing to the natural constraint of boundedness on the dissipation rate at the wall. This new formula agrees well with the existing data and, in contrast to the logarithmic growth, supports the classical wall-scaling for turbulent intensity at asymptotically high Reynolds numbers.},

(2007) in terms of the meandering “superstructures” observed in pipe, channel and boundary layers; and (3) the streaks associated with longitudinal vortex-like structures in the near-wall region, as identiﬁed by Kline et al. (1967). The new model maps the attributes of each eddy type in physical space to wavenumber space. Experimental data are then used to determine the scaling behavior of the three basic eddy motions in wavenumber space, and the scaling behavior of the Reynolds stress behavior is recovered b! y integrating over all wavenumbers.},

	abstract = {The rough-wall turbulent boundary-layer wall pressure spectrum differs from that on a smooth wall because the strengths of the turbulence Reynolds stresses responsible for the pressure fluctuations are increased by surface roughness, and because the near fields of those enhanced pressure sources are redistributed in wavenumber by diffraction by the roughness elements. In this paper, analyses are performed that indicate that, except at very low frequencies, the diffractive component dominates the spectrum in the low-wavenumber and acoustic domains. The diffraction calculations are performed exactly for a plane wall roughened by a distribution of rigid hemispherical bosses, and a comparison is made with corresponding predictions obtained when only the first non-trivial term is retained in an expansion of the rough-wall boundary condition about that for a plane wall. These calculations take no account of interstitial flows and possible wake formation by the roughness elements, and an empirical model of the spectrum is proposed to incorporate these effects and recommended for use in applications. The values of adjustable coefficients that enter the proposed formula are estimated by reference to published experimental data on the radiation of sound by a rough-wall boundary layer. Such data are incomplete, however, and further experiments need to be performed to validate the model.},

	abstract = {A depiction of the mean and ﬂuctuating vorticity structure in turbulent wall ﬂows is presented and described within the context of the self-similar properties admitted by the mean dynamical equation. Data from a relatively wide range of numerical and physical experiments are used to explore and clarify the structure postulated. The mean vorticity indicator for the onset of the four-layer regime of the mean dynamics is revealed. With increasing Reynolds number, the mean vorticity is shown to segregate into two increasingly well-deﬁned domains. Half of the mean vorticity concentrates into a near-wall region of width (relative to the overall ﬂow width) that diminishes proportionally to the inverse square root of Reynolds number. The remainder of the mean vorticity is spread, with diminishing amplitude, over an outer domain that approaches the overall ﬂow width at high Reynolds number. Vorticity stretching and reorientation are surmised to be the characteristic mechanisms accounting for the inner domain behaviour of both the mean and ﬂuctuating vorticity. Vorticity dispersion via advective transport is surmised to be the characteristic mechanism in the outer domain. In this domain, the ﬂuctuating enstrophy approaches that of the instantaneous enstrophy with increasing Reynolds number. This underpins an emerging self-similarity between the mean and r.m.s. vorticity in the domain where the mean velocity proﬁle is logarithmic. The Reynolds number dependence of a number of properties associated with the vorticity ﬁeld is explored and quantiﬁed. The study closes with brief account of the combined vortical and mean dynamical structure of turbulent wall ﬂows.},

	abstract = {In the flows of interest, the mean effect of turbulent inertia can be expressed as the difference of two velocity vorticity correlations. This difference must be sufficiently non-zero if turbulent inertia is to have a net influence on the mean dynamics. One of the correlations is physically related to change of scale effects, while the other is related to advective vorticity transport. The vorticity transport mechanism is studied under the influence of increasing scale separation. Through the use of both laboratory and field data, the scale separation between the fluctuations of wall-normal velocity, v, and spanwise vorticity ωz, are shown to increase with distance from the wall and Reynolds number. Time-delayed correlations between these quantities reveal that only slight variations in their average phase would cause significant variations in the mean transport of momentum. Spectra are used to explore previous observations of scale selection between v and ωz. The wavelengths corresponding to the peaks in the v and ωz spectra are used to describe scale separation effects. The variations in the wavelength ratios are shown to correlate with the scaling properties that follow from the magnitude ordering of terms in the mean momentum equation. Scale separation is seen to result from two mechanisms: spatial confinement and spatial dispersion. The influence of vorticity stretching apparently generates motions bearing concentrated vorticity that, with increasing Reynolds number, are confined to a smaller fraction of the region where the mean viscous force is of leading order. Where the mean dynamics are inertially dominated, the characteristic vortical motions are advectively dispersed. The width of this domain asymptotically grows like the boundary layer thickness. In the region y+ ≲ 40, the streamwise correlation lengths of v and ωz are shown to scale with the square root of the Reynolds number. This is consistent with inner-outer interactions suggested by the scaling structure of the mean momentum equation.},

Fluid Mech., vol. 658, 2010, pp. 336–382), in order to obtain a description of the streamwise turbulence intensity from direct consideration of the Navier–Stokes equations. Under this formulation, the velocity ﬁeld is decomposed into propagating waves (with single streamwise and spanwise wavelengths and wave speed) whose wall-normal shapes are determined from the principal singular function of the corresponding resolvent operator. Using the accepted scalings of the mean velocity in wall-bounded turbulent ﬂows, we establish that the resolvent operator admits three classes of wave parameters that induce universal behaviour with Reynolds number in the low-rank model, and which are consistent with scalings proposed throughout the wall turbulence literature. In addition, it is shown that a necessary condition for geometrically self-similar resolvent modes is the presence of a logarithmic turbulent mean velocity. Under the practical assumption that the mean velocity consists of a logarithmic region, we identify the scalings that constitute hierarchies of self-similar modes that are parameterized by the critical wall-normal location where the speed of the mode equals the local turbulent mean velocity. For the rank-1 model subject to broadband forcing, the integrated streamwise energy density takes a universal form which is consistent with the dominant near-wall turbulent motions. When the shape of the forcing is optimized to enforce matching with results from direct numerical simulations at low turbulent Reynolds numbers, further similarity appears. Representation of these weight functions using similarity laws enables prediction of the Reynolds number and wall-normal variations of the streamwise energy intensity at high Reynolds numbers (Reτ ≈ 103–1010). Results from this low-rank model of the Navier–Stokes equations compare favourably with experimental results in the literature.},

	abstract = {Sub-convective wall pressure ﬂuctuations play a critical role in vibroacoustic and noise analyses of vehicle structures as they serve as the primary forcing function. However, measuring these ﬂuctuations is challenging due to their weak pressure magnitudes, typically 10−3−10−5 of convective ﬂuctuations. This study introduces a non-intrusive measurement technique using an array of multi-pore Helmholtz resonator sensors to capture sub-convective ﬂuctuations with high resolution. The array features largearea, spanwise-oriented sensors arranged linearly for optimal sampling. Results provide a continuous streamwise wavenumber–frequency spectrum, resolving sub-convective ﬂuctuations with sufﬁcient range and accuracy. Convergence analysis indicates that long sampling durations, O(106δ∗/U∞), δ∗ is the displacement thickness of the boundary layer. U∞ is the freestream velocity are necessary to capture true sub-convective levels. Comparisons with four existing wall pressure models, which account for sensor area averaging, reveal discrepancies in predicted levels, convection speed relations and convective ridge characteristics. Notably, the measured data align most closely with the Chase (1980, J. Sound Vib., vol. 70, pp. 29–67) model at convective peak levels and in the sub-convective domain. However, the observed roll-off at wavenumbers exceeding the convective wavenumber decays more slowly than predicted, giving the convective ridge an asymmetric proﬁle about the convective line. These ﬁndings underscore the need for improved wall pressure models that incorporate frequency-dependent convective speed relations, ridge asymmetry, and more accurate sub-convective levels. Further validation using a microphone array from Farabee \& Geib (1991) conﬁrms the accuracy of our measurements, which indicate sub-convective pressure levels lower than reported previously.},

	abstract = {The most widely used generative models map noise and data distributions by matching flows or scores. However, they struggle to incorporate partial observations and additional priors--something energy-based models (EBMs) handle elegantly by simply adding corresponding scalar energy terms. We address this issue by proposing Energy Matching, a framework that endows flow-based approaches with the flexibility of EBMs. Far from the data manifold, samples move along curl-free, optimal transport paths from noise to data. As they approach the data manifold, an entropic energy term guides the system into a Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, explicitly capturing the underlying likelihood structure of the data. We parameterize this dynamic with a single time-independent scalar field, which serves as both a powerful generator and a flexible prior for effective regularization of inverse problems. Our method substantially outperforms existing EBMs on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet generation in terms of fidelity, while retaining simulation-free training of transport-based approaches away from the data manifold. Furthermore, we leverage the method's flexibility to introduce an interaction energy that supports diverse mode exploration, which we demonstrate in a controlled protein-generation setting. Our approach focuses on learning a scalar potential energy--without time-conditioning, auxiliary generators, or additional networks--which marks a significant departure from recent EBM methods. We believe that this simplified framework significantly advances EBMs capabilities and paves the way for their wider adoption in generative modeling across diverse domains.},

	abstract = {The probability density function (p.d.f.) of the streamwise velocity has been shown to indicate the presence of uniform momentum zones in wall-bounded turbulent ﬂows. Most studies on the topic have focused on the instantaneous characteristics of this p.d.f. In this work, we show how the use of time-resolved particle image velocimetry data highlights robust features in the temporal behaviour of the p.d.f. and how these patterns are associated with the change of the number of zones present in the ﬂow over time. The use of a limited resolvent model provides a clear link between this experimentally observed behaviour and the underlying velocity structures and their phase characteristics. This link is further supported by an extended resolvent model consisting of self-similar hierarchies centred in the logarithmic region, with triadically consistent members, yielding much more complex patterns in the p.d.f. Results indicate that the geometric similarity of these members instantaneously, as well as their relative evolution in time (dictated by their wall-normal varying wave speed), both inherent to the model, can reproduce many experimentally identiﬁed features.},

	abstract = {Enormous efforts have been devoted to the prediction and control of turbulent wall ﬂows. A primary consideration here is the Reynolds number scaling problem in which non-dimensional representations are sought that render the normalized variables of interest unchanged for varying Reynolds number. Relative to this objective and in contrast to the mean velocity, there remains a considerable lack of clarity associated with the apparent failure of inner normalization (i.e. using the friction velocity and kinematic viscosity) when applied to the statistical proﬁles of ﬂuctuating quantities in the near-wall region. In their present work Chen \& Sreenivasan (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 933, 2022, A20) generalize their earlier effort, Chen \& Sreenivasan (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 908, 2021, R3), and present a rational framework for characterizing and describing the evolution of turbulence quantities that either attain a near-wall peak or have non-zero wall values. Their analysis enjoys considerable empirical support. Physically, the asymptotic boundedness of the inner-normalized dissipation is used to reason that there is a limiting state of near-wall turbulence at asymptotically large Reynolds numbers. The law of bounded dissipation arguments put forth by Chen and Sreenivasan prescribe the recovery of inner scaling and suggest new possibilities regarding the physics of how wall turbulence matures to its asymptotic state.},

In the present experimental set-up the boundary layer is under modest APG conditions, where the Clauser PG parameter β is ≤1.8. Well-resolved hot-wire measurements are obtained at the Flow Physics Facility at the University of New Hampshire in the region of an APG ramp. Comparisons are made with zero pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer (ZPG TBL) experimental data at similar Reynolds number and numerical simulation data at lower Reynolds number. The main aims of the present study centre on the inertial sublayer of the APG TBL and the degree to which its characteristics are similar to those of the ZPG TBL. This investigation utilizes equation-based analyses and empirical approaches. Among other results, the data suggest that even though the APG TBL streamwise variance does not exhibit a logarithmic proﬁle (unlike the ZPG TBL) both ZPG and APG TBLs exhibit distance-from-the-wall scaling on the inertial sublayer. Theoretical arguments suggest that wall-distance scaling resulting from a self-similar dynamics is consistent with both a single velocity scale leading to a log-law in mean velocity proﬁle as well as multiple velocity scales leading to a power-law mean velocity proﬁle.},

Following the framework of Wei et al. (2005) [1,2], the analysis employs a theory based on the magnitude ordering of terms in the mean thermal energy equation of wall-bounded turbulent heat transfer. A four layer thermal structure has been identiﬁed from the leading order terms in the mean energy equation. A review of the limitations of traditional and existing scaling of mean temperature and turbulent heat ﬂux is conducted. The possibilities of a new scaling approach with the introduction of generalized thermal length scale are discussed within the context of the four-layer framework. This methodology generally seeks to determine the invariant form(s) admitted by the relevant equation. Investigation of normalized statistical quantities applicable to inner, outer and intermediate regions of the ﬂow, whose properties are dependent on a small parameter that is a function of either Reynolds number or both Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, shows inconsistencies between the normalizations on the different subdomains. Although the present scaling approach successfully explores the generalized properties of intermediate layer, issues pertaining to simultaneously and self-consistently reconciling the inner and intermediate normalizations remain unresolved.},

This leads to the proportion of pressure drop attributable to pressure drag being approximately 50 \%, and rising to approximately 85 \% in transitional rough-wall flow. The near-wall structure of turbulent flow is seen to be heavily influenced by the effects of flow separation and reattachment. Farther from the wall, the statistical profiles examined exhibit behaviours characteristic of smooth-wall flows or distributed roughness rough-wall flows. These observations support Townsend’s wall-similarity hypothesis. The organized nature of the present roughness allows the mean pressure drop to be written as a function of the corrugation height. When this is exploited in an analysis of the mean dynamical equation, the scaling problem is explicitly revealed to result from the combined influences of roughness and Reynolds number.

	abstract = {The properties of the mean momentum balance in turbulent boundary layer, pipe and channel flows are explored both experimentally and theoretically. Available high-quality data reveal a dynamically relevant four-layer description that is a departure from the mean profile four-layer description traditionally and nearly universally ascribed to turbulent wall flows. Each of the four layers is characterized by a predominance of two of the three terms in the governing equations, and thus the mean dynamics of these four layers are unambiguously defined. The inner normalized physical extent of three of the layers exhibits significant Reynolds-number dependence. The scaling properties of these layer thicknesses are determined. Particular significance is attached to the viscous/Reynolds-stress-gradient balance layer since its thickness defines a required length scale. Multiscale analysis (necessarily incomplete) substantiates the four-layer structure in developed turbulent channel flow. In particular, the analysis verifies the existence of at least one intermediate layer, with its own characteristic scaling, between the traditional inner and outer layers. Other information is obtained, such as (i) the widths (in order of magnitude) of the four layers, (ii) a flattening of the Reynolds stress profile near its maximum, and (iii) the asymptotic increase rate of the peak value of the Reynolds stress as the Reynolds number approaches infinity. Finally, on the basis of the experimental observation that the velocity increments over two of the four layers are unbounded with increasing Reynolds number and have the same order of magnitude, there is additional theoretical evidence (outside traditional arguments) for the asymptotically logarithmic character of the mean velocity profile in two of the layers; and (in order of magnitude) the mean velocity increments across each of the four layers are determined. All of these results follow from a systematic train of reasoning, using the averaged momentum balance equation together with other minimal assumptions, such as that the mean velocity increases monotonically from the wall.},

	abstract = {Multi-scale analysis of the mean equation for passive scalar transport is used to investigate the asymptotic scaling structure of fully developed turbulent channel ﬂow subjected to uniform heat generation. Unlike previous studies of channel ﬂow heat transport with ﬁxed surface temperature or constant inward surface ﬂux, the present ﬂow has a constant outward wall ﬂux that accommodates for the volumetrically uniform heat generation. This conﬁguration has distinct analytical advantages relative to precisely elucidating the underlying self-similar structure admitted by the mean transport equation. The present analyses are advanced using direct numerical simulations (Pirozzoli et al., 2016) that cover friction Reynolds numbers up to dþ ¼ 4088 and Prandtl numbers ranging from Pr ¼ 0:2–1:0. The leading balances of terms in the mean equation are determined empirically and then analytically described. Consistent with its asymptotic universality, the logarithmic mean temperature proﬁle is shown analytically to arise as a similarity solution to the mean scalar equation, with this solution emerging (as dþ ! 1) on an interior domain where molecular diffusion effects are negligible. In addition to clarifying the Reynolds and Prandtl number inﬂuences on the von Kármán constant for temperature, kh, the present theory also provides a couple of self-consistent ways to estimate, kh. As with previous empirical observations, the present analytical predictions for kh indicate values that are larger than found for the mean velocity von Kármán constant. The potential origin of this is brieﬂy discussed.},

	abstract = {A reﬁned scaling analysis of the two-dimensional mean momentum balance (MMB) for the zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer (TBL) is presented and experimentally investigated up to high friction Reynolds numbers, δ+. For canonical boundary layers, the mean inertia, which is a function of the wall-normal distance, appears instead of the constant mean pressure gradient force in the MMB for pipes and channels. The constancy of the pressure gradient has led to theoretical treatments for pipes/channels, that are more precise than for the TBL. Elements of these analyses include the logarithmic behaviour of the mean velocity, speciﬁcation of the Reynolds shear stress peak location, the square-root Reynolds number scaling for the log layer onset and a well-deﬁned layer structure based on the balance of terms in the MMB. The present analyses evidence that similarly well-founded results also hold for turbulent boundary layers. This follows from transforming the mean inertia term in the MMB into a form that resembles that in pipes/channels, and is constant across the outer inertial region of the TBL. The physical reasoning is that the mean inertia is primarily a large-scale outer layer contribution, the ‘shape’ of which becomes invariant of δ+ with increasing δ+, and with a ‘magnitude’ that is inversely proportional to δ+. The present analyses are enabled and corroborated using recent high resolution, large Reynolds number hot-wire measurements of all the terms in the TBL MMB.},

	abstract = {The combined roughness/Reynolds number problem is explored. Existing and newly acquired data from zero pressure gradient rough-wall turbulent boundary layers are used to clarify the leading order balances of terms in the mean dynamical equation. For the variety of roughnesses examined, it is revealed that the mean viscous force retains dominant order above (and often well above) the roughness crests. Mean force balance data are shown to be usefully organized relative to the characteristic length scale, which is equal or proportional to the width of the region from the wall to where the leading order mean dynamics become described by a balance between the mean and turbulent inertia. This is equivalently the width of the region from the wall to where the mean viscous force loses leading order. For both smooth-wall and roughwall ﬂows, the wall-normal extent of this region consistently ends just beyond the zerocrossing of the turbulent inertia term. In smooth-wall ﬂow this characteristic length is a known function of Reynolds number. The present analyses indicate that for roughwall ﬂows the wall-normal position where the mean dynamics become inertial is an irreducible function of roughness and Reynolds number, as it is an inherent function of the relative scale separations between the inner, roughness, and outer lengths. These ﬁndings indicate that, for any given roughness, new dynamical regimes will typically emerge as the Reynolds number increases. For the present range of parameters, there appear to be three identiﬁable regimes. These correspond to the ratio of the equivalent sand grain roughness to the characteristic length being less than, equal to, or greater than O(1). The relative inﬂuences of the inner, outer, and roughness length scales on the characteristic length are explored empirically. A prediction for the decay rate of the mean vorticity is developed via extension of the smooth-wall theory. Existing data are shown to exhibit good agreement with this extension. Overall, the present results appear to expose unifying connections between the structure of smooth- and rough-wall ﬂows. Among other ﬁndings, the present analyses show promise toward providing a self-consistent and dynamically meaningful way of identifying the domain where the wall similarity hypothesis, if operative, should hold.},

Data from a relatively wide range of numerical and physical experiments are used to explore and clarify the structure postulated. The mean vorticity indicator for the onset of the four-layer regime of the mean dynamics is revealed. With increasing Reynolds number, the mean vorticity is shown to segregate into two increasingly well-deﬁned domains. Half of the mean vorticity concentrates into a near-wall region of width (relative to the overall ﬂow width) that diminishes proportionally to the inverse square root of Reynolds number. The remainder of the mean vorticity is spread, with diminishing amplitude, over an outer domain that approaches the overall ﬂow width at high Reynolds number. Vorticity stretching and reorientation are surmised to be the characteristic mechanisms accounting for the inner domain behaviour of both the mean and ﬂuctuating vorticity. Vorticity dispersion via advective transport is surmised to be the characteristic mechanism in the outer domain. In this domain, the ﬂuctuating enstrophy approaches that of the instantaneous enstrophy with increasing Reynolds number. This underpins an emerging self-similarity between the mean and r.m.s. vorticity in the domain where the mean velocity proﬁle is logarithmic. The Reynolds number dependence of a number of properties associated with the vorticity ﬁeld is explored and quantiﬁed. The study closes with brief account of the combined vortical and mean dynamical structure of turbulent wall ﬂows.},

	abstract = {This study investigates how and why dynamical self-similarities emerge with increasing Reynolds number within the canonical wall ﬂows beyond the transitional regime. An overarching aim is to advance a mechanistically coherent description of turbulent wall-ﬂow dynamics that is mathematically tractable and grounded in the mean dynamical equations. As revealed by the analysis of Fife, Klewicki \& Wei (J. Discrete Continuous Dyn. Syst. A, vol. 24, 2009, pp. 781–807), the equations that respectively describe the mean dynamics of turbulent channel, pipe and boundary layer ﬂows formally admit invariant forms. These expose an underlying self-similar structure. In all cases, two kinds of dynamical self-similarity are shown to exist on an internal domain that, for all Reynolds numbers, extends from O(ν/uτ ) to O(δ), where ν is the kinematic viscosity, uτ is the friction velocity and δ is the half-channel height, pipe radius, or boundary layer thickness. The simpler of the two self-similarities is operative on a large outer portion of the relevant domain. This self-similarity leads to an explicit analytical closure of the mean momentum equation. This self-similarity also underlies the emergence of a logarithmic mean velocity proﬁle. A more complicated kind a self-similarity emerges asymptotically over a smaller domain closer to the wall. The simpler self-similarity allows the mean dynamical equation to be written as a closed system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that, like the similarity solution for the laminar ﬂat-plate boundary layer, can be numerically integrated. The resulting similarity solutions are demonstrated to exhibit nearly exact agreement with direct numerical simulations over the solution domain speciﬁed by the theory. At the Reynolds numbers investigated, the outer similarity solution is shown to be operative over a domain that encompasses ∼40 \% of the overall width of the ﬂow. Other properties predicted by the theory are also shown to be well supported by existing data.},

	abstract = {High resolution direct numerical simulation (DNS) data are used to investigate properties of similarity solutions for the mean velocity (U) and Reynolds shear stress (T) in turbulent channel ﬂow. The analysis uses the method of Fife et al. (Multiscale Model. Simul., vol. 4, 2005, p. 936) for determining the asymptotic scaling properties of indeterminate equations. Subject to its primary assumption, the analysis yields an invariant form of the mean momentum equation that is valid over a signiﬁcant portion of the ﬂow domain. Because the requisite coordinate transformations yield a self-similar relationship between scaled wall-normal derivatives of U and T, this procedure inherently closes the mean equation. These transformations incorporate use of the so-called Fife similarity parameter, φ. The asymptotic constancy of φ (→ φc) on the inertial sublayer is analytically related to the von Kármán constant by κ = φc−2. Integrations of the transformed mean equation are shown to independently yield similarity solutions for both U and T, and the veracity of these solutions is examined in detail. DNS data at δ+ 8000 reveal that the primary assumption of the analysis is satisﬁed to within a deviation of less than 0.1 \%. The present solutions and their associated similarity structure are further used to generate a number of new results. These include a cogent speciﬁcation for the both the inner and outer boundaries of the inertial sublayer and a variety of well-founded ways to estimate φc at ﬁnite Reynolds number. Extensions of the analytical arguments by Klewicki et al. (Phys. Rev. E, vol. 90, 2014, 063015) support the conjecture that φc → Φ = (1 + √5)/2 (or equivalently, κ = 2/(3 + √5)) at large Reynolds number. Connections between the channel solutions and those in the other canonical wall ﬂows are brieﬂy discussed, as are potential implications of the present results relative to wall-ﬂow model development.},

	abstract = {This paper provides a multiscale analytical study of steady incompressible turbulent ﬂow through a channel of either Couette or pressure-driven Poiseuille type. Mathematically, the paper’s two most novel features are that (1) the analysis begins with an underdetermined singular perturbation problem, namely the Reynolds averaged mean momentum balance equation, and (2) it leads to the existence of an inﬁnite number of length scales. (These two features are probably linked, but the linkage will not be pursued.) The paper develops a credible assumption of a mathematical nature which, when added to the initial underdetermined problem, results in a knowledge of almost the complete layer (scaling) structure of the mean velocity and Reynolds stress proﬁles. This structure in turn provides a lot of other important information about those proﬁles. The possibility of almostlogarithmic sections of the mean velocity proﬁle is given special attention. The sense in which the length scales are asymptotically proportional to the distance from the wall is determined. Most traditional theoretical analyses of these wall-bounded ﬂows are based ultimately on either the classical overlap hypothesis, mixing length concepts, or similarity arguments. The present paper avoids those approaches and their attendant assumptions. Empirical data are also not used, except that the Reynolds stress takes on positive values. Instead, reasonable criteria are proposed for recognizing scaling layers in the ﬂow, and they are then used to determine the scaling structure and much more information.},

	abstract = {Steady Couette and pressure-driven turbulent channel flows have large regions in which the gradients of the viscous and Reynolds stresses are approximately in balance (stress gradient balance regions). In the case of Couette flow, this region occupies the entire channel. Moreover, the relevant features of pressure-driven channel flow throughout the channel can be obtained from those of Couette flow by a simple transformation. It is shown that stress gradient balance regions are characterized by an intrinsic hierarchy of ‘scaling layers’ (analogous to the inner and outer domains), filling out the stress gradient balance region except for locations near the wall. The spatial extent of each scaling layer is found asymptotically to be proportional to its distance from the wall.
            
              There is a rigorous connection between the scaling hierarchy and the mean velocity profile. This connection is through a certain function
              \$A(y{\textasciicircum}+)\$
              defined in terms of the hierarchy, which remains
              \$O(1)\$
              for all
              \$y{\textasciicircum}+\$
              . The mean velocity satisfies an exact logarithmic growth law in an interval of the hierarchy if and only if
              \$A\$
              is constant. Although
              \$A\$
              is generally not constant in any such interval, it is arguably almost constant under certain circumstances in some regions. These results are obtained completely independently of classical inner/outer/overlap scaling arguments, which require more restrictive assumptions.

Maths, vol. 3, 1945, pp. 38–54), but also further into volume (p′(r;V) and p′(s;V)) and surface (wall echo, p′(r;w) and p′(s;w)) terms. An algorithm, based on a Green’s function approach, is developed to compute the above splittings for various correlations containing pressure ﬂuctuations (redistribution, pressure diffusion, velocity pressure-gradient), in fully developed turbulent plane channel ﬂow. This exact analysis conﬁrms previous results based on a method-of-images approximation (Manceau, Wang \& Laurence, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 438, 2001, pp. 307–338) showing that, at the wall, p′(V) and p′(w) are usually of the same sign and approximately equal. The above results are then used to study the contribution of each mechanism to the pressure correlations in low-Reynoldsnumber plane channel ﬂow, and to discuss standard second-moment-closure modelling practices.},
